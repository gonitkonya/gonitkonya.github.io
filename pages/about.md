The initiative to train, test and send Bangladeshi girls to international mathematical competitions was taken by Ipshita Bonhi Upoma, an MSC student at Durham University. She has successfully made Bangladesh participate in the European Girl's Mathematical Olympiad in 2021 and 2022 with the help of her associates: Mursalin Habib, Nishat Anjum Bristy, Ahmed Zawad Chowdhury and Prof. Mahbub Majumdar. The team of 2021 won 1 silver medal and 1 bronze medal with a total score of 27. And the team of 2022 won 2 bronze medals and 2 honorable mentions with a staggering score of 57. The score of the team increased by 30 in just one year. In 2023, Tamanna Islam Urmi, a Ph.D. student from Northeastern University and Md Zahidul Hasan Zadid, a lecturer from BRAC University joined forces with her to make it a tradition to send Bangladeshi girls to international competitions.
