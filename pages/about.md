The initiative to train, test and send Bangladeshi girls to international mathematical competitions was taken by Ipshita Bonhi Upoma, an MSC student at Durham University. She has successfully made Bangladesh participate in the European Girl's Mathematical Olympiad in 2021 and 2022 with the help of her associates: Mursalin Habib, Nishat Anjum Bristy, Ahmed Zawad Chowdhury and Prof. Mahbub Majumdar. In 2023, Tamanna Islam Urmi, a Ph.D. student from Northeastern University and Md Zahidul Hasan Zadid, a lecturer from BRAC University joined forces with her to make it a lasting convention to send Bangladeshi girls to international competitions.
